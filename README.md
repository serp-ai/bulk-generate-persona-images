# README

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that can be used to download a large number of images from the website [thispersondoesnotexist.com](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/). 

The images are generated by a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) and are not real people. 

The images are generated in on the fly from an `input.csv` file you provide that contains a list of people's Names & Genders.

The deepface library is used to identify if the generated image is male or female and then the image is saved in the respective folder, with the person's name as the filename.

The images are cropped to remove the stupid watermark crap that the website adds to the bottom of the images.

## How to use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook `bulk-download-images.ipynb` in Jupyter.
3. Create an `input.csv` file with the following columns: `Name` and `Gender`.
4. Run the Jupyter notebook!

// I dont recommend using MyBinder (it's slow AF)
